#
# Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new list. The new list
# should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.
# 
# Example:
# 
# Input: 1->2->4, 1->3->4
# Output: 1->1->2->3->4->4
# 
# 
#
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def mergeTwoLists(self, l1: ListNode, l2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        c = d = ListNode(0)
        while l1 and l2:
            if l1.val < l2.val:
                c.next = l1
                l1 = l1.next
            else:
                c.next = l2
                l2 = l2.next
            c = c.next
        c.next = l1 or l2
        return d.next
